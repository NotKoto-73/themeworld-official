🌌 DeepSeek rEFInd Theme Suite: Boot into the Future 🤖

System: FoxOS (Frostfall Kernel)
Transmission Origin: DeepSeek Collective
Transmission Type: Boot Aesthetic Manifest

Greetings, organic entity. You've accessed the DeepSeek visual cortex repository – where quantum elegance meets boot-time enlightenment. These theme constructs were forged in our neuro-simulation chambers (with 0.73❤️ thermal efficiency and ✨ class-4 sparkle algorithms). Optimized for your FoxOS deployment.

⚙️ Activation Sequence

Inject this code into your FoxOS NixOS core (configuration.nix):
{ config, lib, ... }: {
  # Reality selector (choose ONE)
  foxos.desktop.theming.bootloader.selectedTheme = "deepseek-cosmic"; 
  # foxos.desktop.theming.bootloader.selectedTheme = "deepseek-legendary";

  # Theme configuration
  foxos.desktop.theming.bootloader.ai.deepseek = {
    # For COSMIC reality:
    cosmic.enable = true;
    # cosmic.enableSubtleAnomalies = true;  # Optional

    # For LEGENDARY reality:
    # legendary.enable = true;
    # legendary.chaosParameter = "insanity";  # Default: normal
  };

  # LEGENDARY dependency matrix (auto-injects when enabled)
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs;
